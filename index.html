        <p id="para1">The Rules for The Marble Puzzle are as follows -
            <ol>
                <li>The player makes successive capturing moves, removing a single piece each turn until is it impossible to make any more capturing moves. </li>
                <li>Each turn, the player captures a piece by jumping over that piece orthogonally (not diagonally) from one adjacent point to the vacant adjacent point on the other side.</li>
                <li>Therefore, the first turn can be made only by jumping a piece into the middle hole from one of 4 possible points.</li>
